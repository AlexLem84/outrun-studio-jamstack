# Outrun Studio Hero Section Development - Conversation Log

## Project Overview
Development of a premium hero section with dynamic design showcase carousel for Outrun Studio website, featuring Sanity CMS integration, Ken Burns effects, and retro scanline textures.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Sanity CMS Integration
- ✅ Created `homepageHero` schema for dynamic content management
- ✅ Integrated Sanity client with helper functions (`getHomepageHero`, `urlFor`)
- ✅ Connected hero section to Sanity CMS for dynamic image management
- ✅ Added fallback content for when Sanity data is unavailable

### 2. Hero Section Features
- ✅ Full-width hero section with motion showcase
- ✅ Dynamic carousel with 5 design images from Sanity
- ✅ Smooth fade transitions between slides (1.5s duration)
- ✅ Auto-play functionality with hover-to-pause
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- ✅ Premium navigation dots with glow effects
- ✅ CTA buttons with glass morphism and neon effects

### 3. Visual Effects
- ✅ **Ken Burns Effect**: Enhanced cinematic zoom and pan animations
  - Maximum 1.15x scale (15% zoom)
  - 2% panning movement in different directions
  - 5 unique animation patterns (20-30s cycles)
  - Hover pause functionality
- ✅ **Scanlines Texture**: Retro CRT monitor effect
  - Subtle cyan scanlines with screen blend mode
  - 15% opacity for professional look
  - 3px spacing between lines
  - Moving animation for authentic feel
- ✅ **Premium Background**: Gradient backgrounds with floating orbs
- ✅ **Loading States**: Shimmer animations for image loading

### 4. Technical Implementation
- ✅ TypeScript integration with proper type annotations
- ✅ Image preloading for smooth transitions
- ✅ Error handling for failed image loads
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile optimization
- ✅ Performance optimizations (cubic-bezier easing, transition management)

- **Scale Range**: 1.0x to 1.15x (15% maximum zoom)
- **Pan Range**: 0% to 2% movement in all directions
- **Duration**: 20-30 seconds per cycle
- **Easing**: ease-in-out for smooth motion
- **Patterns**: 5 unique animation sequences

### Scanlines Effect:
- **Color**: Cyan (rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.15))
- **Spacing**: 3px transparent, 1px scanline
- **Blend Mode**: Screen for authentic CRT effect
- **Animation**: Continuous vertical movement

### Transitions:
- **Duration**: 1.5 seconds
- **Easing**: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)
- **Type**: Opacity-based crossfades
- **Auto-play**: 5-second intervals with hover pause

## URLs and Access
- **Development Server**: http://localhost:4322/
