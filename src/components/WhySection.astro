          Why we do it

        <div class="space-y-4 text-xl text-outrun-light-gray leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            I started Outrun Studio for the people who keep towns and cities running — the roofers, lawyers, builders, and small business owners who deserve better than vague reports and inflated retainers.
          </p>
          <p>
            You care about getting results, not learning how marketing works.
            That's where I come in. I'll handle the technical side so you can stay focused on running your business.

        <div class="space-y-4 text-xl text-outrun-light-gray leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            I spend my time between Idaho Falls, Paris, and Switzerland.
            That mix gives our studio a unique edge — global creative quality with local business focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            We work with clients across the U.S. and Europe, from small service shops to established brands. No timezone or distance issues. Just good communication and better results.
